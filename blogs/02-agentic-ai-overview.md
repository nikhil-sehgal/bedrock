# Agentic AI: The Future of Autonomous Systems

Agentic AI refers to AI systems that can take **autonomous actions** toward achieving goals, instead of just passively responding to prompts.

### ðŸ§© Characteristics of Agentic AI
- Goal-driven (not just instruction-based)
- Maintains short-term or long-term memory
- Can use tools/APIs autonomously
- Often multi-agent (collaborating agents)

### âš¡ Example Applications
- AI project managers (plan, assign, monitor tasks)
- Travel planners (research routes, compare prices, book tickets)
- Data agents (scrape, analyze, summarize)

### ðŸ”® Future Outlook
Agentic AI will reshape industries by automating complex workflows where traditional LLMs fall short. With orchestration frameworks like **LangGraph** and **AutoGen**, the field is rapidly evolving.
