# Autonomous Agents in Agentic AI

Autonomous agents are AI systems that can **take actions independently** to achieve goals. Unlike traditional LLMs, they don’t just respond—they plan, decide, and execute.

### Core Components
- **Goal Identification:** Understand the task or objective.
- **Planning Module:** Break goals into actionable steps.
- **Action Executor:** Interact with APIs, databases, or users.
- **Memory:** Track history to make better decisions.
- **Evaluation:** Check if goals are met and adjust.

### Example Use Cases
- Booking flights and hotels automatically
- Research assistant that gathers and summarizes data
- Personal finance manager that optimizes savings
- Multi-agent collaboration in corporate workflows
