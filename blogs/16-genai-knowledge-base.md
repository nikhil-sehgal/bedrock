# Building a Custom Knowledge Base with GenAI

One of the most valuable enterprise use cases is creating a **GenAI-powered knowledge base**.

---

## How It Works
1. **Document Ingestion** → PDFs, Word docs, CSVs.  
2. **Chunking & Embedding** → Breaking text into pieces and converting into vectors.  
3. **Storage** → Save embeddings in a vector database.  
4. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** → Combine user queries with relevant docs.  
5. **Answer Generation** → AI provides grounded responses.

## Benefits
- Employees spend less time searching.  
- Accurate answers from internal data.  
- Knowledge retention for scaling teams.  

---

## Tech Stack
- **LangChain / LlamaIndex** for ingestion.  
- **Pinecone / Weaviate / FAISS** for vector storage.  
- **Bedrock / OpenAI APIs** for response generation.

### Takeaway
Custom knowledge bases transform scattered company data into **actionable intelligence**, making AI a true enterprise co-pilot.
