# Multi-Agent Collaboration

Agentic AI becomes more powerful when **multiple agents** work together.

### Collaboration Patterns
- **Specialist Agents** → Each focuses on one domain (finance, research, travel).
- **Coordinator Agent** → Manages delegation & integration.
- **Negotiating Agents** → Discuss and agree on solutions.

### Example Use Cases
- AI research team (data collection agent + summarization agent + writer agent).
- AI-driven supply chain (forecasting agent + logistics agent + pricing agent).
- Smart cities (traffic agent + energy agent + emergency agent).

### Future Outlook
Multi-agent ecosystems could function like **digital organizations**, running 24/7.
