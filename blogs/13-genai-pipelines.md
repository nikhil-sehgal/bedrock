# Building GenAI Pipelines with Orchestration Tools

Generative AI becomes truly powerful when integrated into **pipelines**. A pipeline is a sequence of steps where inputs are processed, transformed, and enriched by multiple AI or non-AI components.

---

## Components
1. **Input Layer** – Raw user queries or documents.  
2. **Preprocessing** – Clean and structure the input.  
3. **LLM/Model Call** – Generate or transform content.  
4. **Post-Processing** – Format, filter, or validate outputs.  
5. **Integration Layer** – Store in databases or send via APIs.  

---

## Use Cases
- RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) workflows  
- AI-powered content moderation  
- Multi-step Q&A bots with fact-checking  
- Automated document processing  

---

## Tools
- **LangChain** – LLM orchestration framework  
- **LlamaIndex** – Document ingestion & retrieval  
- **Prefect / Airflow** – Workflow automation  
- **Bedrock & OpenAI APIs** – Generative power  

---

### Takeaway
Pipelines turn standalone AI models into **production-ready systems** that can scale across industries.
