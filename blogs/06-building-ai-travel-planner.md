# Building an AI Travel Planner with Agentic AI ✈️

Planning trips often involves dozens of steps: finding flights, comparing hotels, checking weather, and creating itineraries. Agentic AI can simplify this.

### How It Works
1. User sets a goal → "Plan a 3-day trip to New York."
2. Agent searches for flights and hotels.
3. Agent checks weather and suggests activities.
4. Agent creates a day-wise itinerary.

### Tools You Can Use
- **LangChain / CrewAI** for agent orchestration
- **Bedrock or OpenAI** for language reasoning
- **Map APIs** for geolocation & routes
- **Weather APIs** for climate info

### Why This Matters
Instead of juggling 5+ apps, a single AI agent can deliver a personalized travel plan — saving time and making travel more enjoyable.
